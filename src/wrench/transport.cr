  # I â€™m going to make a long talk here, about why I did this (all_transport)
  # Some time ago, I found that if the client is writing data to Remote, if Remote is also reading at the same time, it will trigger the problem of read timeout, and vice versa.
  # So far, I still don't know if it is a bad implementation of Crystal (IO::Evented).
  # So I thought of this solution.
  # When the timeout is triggered, immediately check whether the other party (upload / receive) has completed the transmission, otherwise continue to loop IO.copy.
  # At the same time, in order to avoid the infinite loop problem, I added the maximum number of attempts.
  # This ensures that there is no disconnection when transferring data for a long time.
  # Taking a 30-second timeout as an example, 30 * maximum number of attempts (default: 64) = 1920 seconds
